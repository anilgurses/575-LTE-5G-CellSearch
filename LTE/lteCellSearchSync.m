%% Cell Search, MIB and SIB1 Recovery 
% This example shows how to fully synchronize, demodulate and decode a live
% eNodeB signal by using LTE Toolbox(TM) software. Before the user
% equipment (UE) can communicate with the network, it must perform cell
% search and selection procedures, and then obtain initial system
% information. This process involves acquiring slot and frame
% synchronization, determining the cell identity and decoding the MIB and
% system information blocks (SIBs). This example demonstrates this process
% and decodes the MIB and SIB1, the first of the system information blocks.
% Decoding the MIB and SIB1 requires a comprehensive that is capable of
% demodulating and decoding the majority of the downlink channels and
% signals.

%% Introduction
% In order to communicate with the network the UE must obtain some basic
% system information. This is carried by the MIB and SIBs. The MIB carries
% the most essential system information:
%
% * System bandwidth
% * System frame number (SFN)
% * Physical hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) indicator channel
% (PHICH) configuration
%
% The MIB is carried on the broadcast channel (BCH) mapped into the
% physical broadcast channel (PBCH). This is transmitted with a fixed
% coding and modulation scheme and can be decoded after the initial cell
% search procedure. With the information obtained from the MIB the UE can
% now decode the control format indicator (CFI), which indicates the
% physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) length. This allows the PDCCH
% to be decoded, and searched for downlink control information (DCI)
% messages. A DCI message CRC masked with system information radio network
% temporary identifier (SI-RNTI) indicates that a SIB is carried in the
% same subframe. The SIBs are transmitted in the broadcast control channel
% (BCCH) logical channel. Generally, BCCH messages are carried on the
% downlink shared channel (DL-SCH) and transmitted on the physical downlink
% shared channel (PDSCH). The format and resource allocation of the PDSCH
% transmission is indicated by a DCI message on the PDCCH.
% 
% This example decodes the MIB and SystemInformationBlockType1 (SIB1). The
% latter is transmitted to specify the scheduling of other system
% information, along with aspects of the cell identity such as Public Land
% Mobile Network (PLMN) identity. Although SIB1 is transmitted in a fixed
% time schedule, the resource allocation of the PDSCH carrying SIB1 is
% dynamic and is indicated in an associated DCI message. 

%% Load and Process I/Q Waveform 
% MATLAB(R) can be used to acquire I/Q data from a wide range of
% instruments using the Instrument Control Toolbox(TM). In this example a
% single antenna I/Q capture of an eNodeB with two transmit antennas is
% used. The capture is performed at 15.36 Msamples/s which is sufficient to
% correctly sample all valid eNodeB bandwidths up to 10 MHz: 1.4 MHz, 3
% MHz, 5 MHz, 10 MHz. The captured data is stored in the file
% eNodeBOutput.mat.
%
% Alternatively, a suitable LTE signal can be generated using the
% LTE Toolbox. This can be controlled by the variable |loadFromFile|.


%%
% The MIB corresponds to one BCH transport block. The BCH Transmission Time
% Interval (TTI), or the time needed to transmit a single transport block,
% is 40msec or 4 frames. The BCH is transmitted in 4 parts, each part
% mapped to the first subframe (subframe 0) of a frame and it is possible
% that each transmission is independently decodable, depending on signal
% conditions. To ensure that subframe 0 is received, the capture should be
% at least 11 subframes long, to account for the possibility that the
% capture is started during subframe 0. For poor signal conditions, all
% 4 parts of the TTI may be required, in which case the capture should be
% at least 41 subframes long. A similar situation applies for SIB1; it is
% transmitted in subframe 5 of every even frame, with four different
% Redundancy Versions (RVs) being transmitted consecutively giving an
% overall period of 80msec or 8 frames. Therefore 21 subframes of capture
% are required to ensure reception of a single RV of SIB1 (in subframe 5 of
% an even frame), but up to 81 subframes of capture are required if signal
% conditions are such that all RVs need to be combined.

% Prior to decoding the MIB, the UE does not know the full system
% bandwidth. The primary and secondary synchronization signals (PSS and
% SSS) and the PBCH (containing the MIB) all lie in the central 72
% subcarriers (6 resource blocks) of the system bandwidth, allowing the UE
% to initially demodulate just this central region. Therefore the bandwidth
% is initially set to 6 resource blocks. The I/Q waveform needs to be
% resampled accordingly. At this stage we also display the spectrum of the
% input signal |eNodeBOutput|.
